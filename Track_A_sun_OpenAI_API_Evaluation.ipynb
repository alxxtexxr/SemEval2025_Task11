      "- Keyword: goblog\n",
      "- Analysis: The term \"goblog\" in Sundanese and Indonesian is often used as an insult, which translates to \"stupid\" or \"fool\" in English. According to the guidelines, insults typically indicate both `anger` and `disgust`. This suggests that the use of \"goblog\" conveys a certain level of contempt or frustration, possibly towards the person described as such or the situation. The speaker might be expressing their irritation or annoyance with the actions of the individual they are describing, which aligns with a sense of anger. Simultaneously, the term could imply a sense of disdain or scorn towards what they perceive as foolish behavior, aligning with the emotion of disgust. The choice of the word \"goblog\" is not just casual criticism; it carries a weight of emotional intensity that usually stems from underlying negative feelings like anger or disgust towards the subject in question.\n",
      "- Emotions: anger, disgust\n",
      "</keyword>\n",
      "\n",
      "<keyword>\n",
      "- Keyword: 😂🤣\n",
      "- Analysis: Both of these emojis are typically associated with laughter and amusement. 😂 is often used to represent \"crying with laughter,\" indicating something is very funny, and `joy` is the primary emotion conveyed. According to the guidelines, laughter-related emojis such as 😂 indicate `joy` unless specified otherwise, and there is no suggestion in the context that would imply an alternative emotion. The use of multiple laughing emojis reinforces the intensity of the amusement. The surrounding context, with the contrast between calling someone \"goblog\" and highlighting a humorous situation (hiding a pack of cigarettes while pretending not to have any) likely adds to the comedic effect and amplifies the sense of joy or humor in the situation. Overall, the laughter emojis suggest that despite any underlying displeasure or criticism, there is an overriding sense of amusement or lightheartedness.\n",

According to the guidelines provided, smile or laugh emojis such as 😁 typically indicate joy. This smile could result from recalling something pleasant, funny, or light-hearted. The context indicates that the user is recalling a situation where the mention of \"tah urang inget\" instantly brought to mind a Gojek advertisement, which in turn led to an amusing thought about not using GoFood. This sequence of thoughts could easily provoke a smile or laughter, hence the use of this emoji. Therefore, based on the guidelines and the surrounding context, 😁 is strongly indicative of joy. Therefore, the appearance of this emoji in the text is consistent with the expression of joy. Building on this understanding, the emoji's role here is to punctuate the anecdote with a sense of humor or light-heartedness. Going back to what I thought earlier, this fits well with the typical contexts where people use such smiling emojis.\n",

According to the guidelines, these emojis typically indicate 'joy' as they symbolize laughter and amusement. Laughing emojis are powerful indicators of humor and happiness, often used to show that something is funny or entertaining. In the context of this sentence, the text is talking about how the songs sung by \"neng bintan\" are all likable and attributes this charm humorously to some kind of magical influence, indicated by the mention of being \"jampean d dukun\" (charmed by a shaman). The use of 🤣🤣🤣 emphasizes that this is meant in a light-hearted, joking manner rather than seriously. So, these emojis reinforce the sense of amusement and joy derived from the idea that the singer's voice is so captivating it must be enchanted, as if by a shaman. This clever use of humor and exaggeration is further solidified by the repeated laughter emojis, which strongly underscore a feeling of joy.\n",

Suspicion generally involves a sense of mistrust or doubt about someone or something, often leading to feelings of uncertainty or apprehension. In this context, someone is suspicious of another person, specifically Asep, who wears glasses. Suspicion can evoke fear, as it can lead to concerns about potential negative outcomes or untrustworthy behavior. It doesn't directly imply anger, but it could be associated with unease or caution regarding Asep's intentions or actions. I should also consider that suspicion might stem from past experiences or preconceived notions, adding layers of complexity to the emotional response. The emotion here is predominantly `fear`, because suspicion often involves apprehension or wariness about what might happen and what the suspect person might do. \n",

Laughter is often associated with happiness or joy, indicating that the context in which \"dekah\" appears is likely intended to be light-hearted or humorous. However, the presence of the word \"curiga\" complicates things, as there could be an underlying tension between the suspicion and the act of laughter. One possibility is that the laughter is nervous or mocking, tied to the suspicion of Asep. Another is that despite the suspicion, there's some amusement or irreverence about the situation. Laughter could also be a social response, used to defuse the tension caused by the suspicion. Either way, the act of chuckling suggests at least some level of amusement or `joy`, even if it's layered with other emotions like fear.\n",

The mention of Asep directly ties to the situation of suspicion and potential laughter, but it doesn’t inherently add a new layer of emotion by itself beyond what \"curiga\" and \"dekah\" already provide. However, by being the subject of both suspicion and laughter, Asep becomes a focal point of both the suspicion (fear) and the amusement (joy), intertwining both emotions further in the context. The suspicion and humor surrounding Asep suggest a dynamic that could be both socially complex and emotionally charged, reflecting a unique social interaction dynamic.\n",

It's an expression that can have different emotional connotations based on the context. Here, it seems to set the tone for a strong emotional response to the memory evoked by the song. The elongated spelling of \"Anjiirrr\" could suggest an intensified reaction, possibly indicating surprise. Let's consider why this might be. In many cases, when someone recalls a powerful or vivid memory, there can be an element of surprise in how strongly they react or remember events. This expression could reflect that surprise in the present situation. However, given the way the text continues with \"lagu ieu mengingatkanku pada hiji momen,\" the rest of the text leans more toward nostalgia or sadness, meaning that \"Anjiirrr\" here doesn’t appear to express something entirely positive or joyful.

In this case, the crying emojis seem to support the notion of sadness tied to a specific memory triggered by the song.

The repetition strengthens the impression of emotional pain or longing, as if the speaker is overwhelmed by the sadness of the memory recalled. It's crucial to note that according to the guidelines, the crying emoji can sometimes imply joy if used humorously.

In the context of this text, the abundant use of the 😢 emoji amplifies the sense of sadness or remembrance tinged with sorrow. Now, let's consider the rest of the message; \"Anjiirrr, lagu ieu mengingatkanku pada hiji momen\" translates to \"Wow, this song reminds me of a moment.\" The word \"Anjiirrr\" is an exclamation that often reflects surprise or emphasis, indicating a strong reaction—potentially emotional, like nostalgia or an intense memory.

      "Now, reflecting on the guidelines and my perception: there are no laughter emojis or keywords suggesting joy here; nor is there any explicit anger, fear, or surprise, apart from the initial exclamation which is diluted by the heavy sadness indicated by the crying emojis.

Therefore, sadness stands out as the predominant emotion, largely driven by the 😢 emoji's presence.\n",

The repetition and emphasis on \"gaskeunn\" in the statement could also imply a strong admiration or attachment, potentially indicating that the person enjoys the concept of \"proceeding\" or feels happiness in encouraging Azmy. It seems this term is not related to negative emotions like anger, sadness, or fear. It may, however, incorporate some elements of surprise if the enthusiasm is unexpected, but primarily, the repeated and emphasized nature aligns with joy. Building on this understanding, I can conclude that the predominant emotion conveyed here by this enthusiasm and encouragement is joy.\n",

      "- Analysis: The word \"tercandu-candu\" translates to \"addicted\" in English. This term, in many contexts, can imply a strong attachment or an overwhelming interest in something. Addictions typically have a negative connotation due to their association with dependency, which might lead to emotions like fear or sadness due to the lack of control. However, in this sentence, the expression \"tercandu-candu sama gaskeun nya teh azmy ni\" suggests a lighter, more humorous or playful addiction to a phrase or behavior associated with Azmy. Could this imply joy then, as it conveys a playful obsession, or perhaps surprise, since the speaker is amazed by how much they like the expression? There's a lack of typical negative connotations since the context is casual and lighthearted. Going back to the guidelines, there’s nothing here to suggest anger or sadness specifically. I must balance my interpretation; given the playful and enthusiastic use, it's more aligned with joy. This emotional coloring makes it more about enjoying the situation than discussing a negative dependency.\n",

      "- Analysis: \"Goblog\" is a Sundanese word that translates to \"stupid\" or \"foolish\" in English. In many cultures, calling someone stupid is generally insulting and can express emotions of disdain or frustration. According to the guidelines, insults typically indicate both `anger` and `disgust`. When you call someone \"goblog,\" it is disrespectful and dismissive of their capabilities or intelligence. This kind of statement often emerges from a place of irritation or judgment about someone's perceived incompetence. The context here seems to use \"goblog\" humorously, as it describes a scenario where a person metaphorically \"sniffs their own fart.\" This is intended to illustrate absurdity rather than a literal insult. However, the underlying tone still carries contempt. It's noteworthy to consider the complexity of humor mixed with insult. While the statement is funny to some, it doesn't fully negate the underlying negative sentiment of ridicule, which aligns with feelings of anger and disgust. Thus, both emotions are present.\n",

When someone expresses that they have nothing for something essential like eating, it typically conveys a sense of lack or insufficiency, leading to feelings of sadness or worry because eating is a basic necessity. Are there other emotions involved here? Possibly, given that it's paired with the fact there's just enough money for something else (\"ongkos\"), but eweuh for food. This contrast might suggest prioritization and an inability to fulfill other important needs, which could bring a sense of helplessness or anxiety. According to my understanding, being unable to afford something as necessary as food often connects to sadness due to the unpleasantness of lacking basic sustenance. This absence could be profoundly impactful on a daily routine, cultivating a sense of deeper distress or sadness.\n",

This word itself doesn't immediately convey a strong emotion but rather politeness and an invitation. However, politeness can sometimes be associated with a neutral or positive emotion, depending on context.

      "- Analysis: Let's delve into this phrase \"karak aya deui.\" In Sundanese, \"karak\" can be translated to \"just\" or \"only now,\" \"aya\" means \"is/are/have,\" and \"deui\" means \"again\" or \"back.\" So, putting it together, it seems to indicate that something or someone has only now appeared or returned. Now, what kind of emotion might this convey? If we think about someone or something's return, it could be a source of joy or relief, especially if the person was missed. However, without explicit indicators of happiness, like laughter or joy-related emojis, I have to consider other possibilities. The return of someone or something could also cause surprise, especially if their reappearance was unexpected. This is typical when someone suddenly sees someone they haven't seen in a while. It's also worth considering if there's any underlying sarcasm or annoyance in \"only now,\" which might imply frustration or even anger because it took longer than expected. However, there are no overt signs of sarcasm or annoyance—including these might be speculative without further context. Let's recap: there's potential joy if the return is welcomed, surprise if it was unexpected, and potentially an element of frustration if there's any suggestion of annoyance (though that's speculative here without explicit cues). However, since no clear guidelines suggest anger or frustration in the language used here, we will not include anger. Given the text's neutrality, I'll conclude the predominant likely emotions are surprise and joy.\n",

The emphasis on \"terussss\" shows an enthusiastic outlook on the future, which ties to feeling of joy. Going back to the idea of expressing happiness or hope, when someone expresses enthusiasm for success, it embodies an optimistic and joyful emotion.

The \"hhe\" reinforces this interpretation by implying a playful, amused, or light-hearted reaction to the situation or suggestion. Based on the guidelines, expressions indicating laughter or amusement often signal `joy`. Therefore, \"hhe\" in this sentence serves as an indicator of cheerfulness and a sense of enjoyment about the song being well-suited for a festive occasion.\n",

      "- Analysis: Let's take a closer look at the phrase \"nyieun lagu deui,\" which translates to \"make another song\" in English. This suggestion is often communicated with a sense of enthusiasm or excitement, especially if someone is encouraging a creative endeavor such as songwriting. When people encourage creativity, there's usually a sense of joy or positive anticipation involved. Now, considering the context of making a song titled \"togel,\" which refers to a lottery, there could be a playful or humorous undertone. If the suggestion is meant humorously, it might carry an element of joy or light-heartedness. However, without additional context indicating negative sentiment, it's reasonable to associate this encouragement primarily with positive emotions like joy or surprise due to the unexpected suggestion.\n",
