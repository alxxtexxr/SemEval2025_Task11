      "You will be provided with a text in Sundanese. Your task is to identify the emotion(s) expressed in the text. This is a multi-label classification task, meaning the text may convey one or more emotions simultaneously. You must always provide a result; there should never be an instance with no identified emotion(s).\n",

      "1. Laughter-like expressions, such as \"hahaha,\" \"wkwkw,\" or similar, typically indicate `joy`.\n",
      "2. Smile or laugh emojis, such as 😊, ☺️, 😃, 😁, 😆, 😇, 🥰, 😍, 😋, 🤗, 😌, typically indicate `joy`.\n",
      "3. Insults typically indicate both `anger` and `disgust`.\n",
      "4. The emoji 😭 does not always indicate `sadness`. In humorous contexts, it can represent extreme laughter that brings tears, indicating `joy`.\n",

      "\n",
      "a. Translate the Keyword\n",
      "- Translate the identified keyword from Sundanese to English. \n",
      "- Understand its meaning in both languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Refer to the Guidelines First\n",
      "- Always refer to the provided guidelines first to determine the emotion(s) associated with the keyword.\n",
      "- If any guideline applies, follow it strictly and conclude your analysis.\n",
      "- If no guideline applies, proceed to construct your reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. Construct Reasoning\n",
      "- Adopt a mindset of self-doubt and curiosity. Ask numerous questions and explore different possibilities.\n",
      "- Avoid rushing to conclusions; instead, iterate and refine your thoughts through multiple rounds of questioning.\n",
      "- Build your understanding progressively by answering questions step by step. If uncertainties remain, continue exploring, reasoning, and revising until a comprehensive understanding emerges.\n",

According to the guidelines, insults typically indicate both `anger` and `disgust`. This is because calling someone foolish generally carries a negative connotation and suggests frustration or contempt towards the person being referred to. There isn't any guideline that directly associates the word \"goblog\" with any other emotion like `joy`, `fear`, `sadness`, or `surprise`, which reinforces the association to `anger` and `disgust` primarily. The usage of \"goblog\" here seems intentional to express a critical opinion about someone's behavior, underlying a sense of impatience or annoyance as well, which aligns with `anger`.\n",

The presence of these emojis at the end of the sentence adds a tone of humor to the entire statement, suggesting that the writer finds the situation of someone hiding cigarettes while pretending not to have them amusing or laughable. While the initial part of the sentence expressed criticism, these emojis soften the tone by introducing a humorous perspective, indicating that even though there is an element of criticism, the overall feeling is one of amusement.

      "- Analysis: Ah, the smile emoji! Now, this is something that usually indicates an emotion like joy or happiness. Let me think about the context here. The person is recalling an advertisement for Gojek right after someone mentioned \"tah urang inget.\" This likely triggers a light-hearted or humorous memory. The presence of the smile emoji reinforces that this situation is seen in a positive or humorous light, rather than anything negative. The smile emoji is a strong indicator, according to the guidelines, of joy. So, even if the rest of the context might suggest something else, unless it's overwhelmingly negative or sad, the smile typically wins out for joy here. I can deduce that the person seems to find something amusing or enjoyable about the situation, perhaps the coincidence of remembering Gojek’s advertisement upon that remark. It seems like this smile is a reaction to the light-heartedness or irony of the situation. There is no insult or severe distress indicated, ruling out anger or fear. So, consistently with the guidelines, this emoji directs the emotional tone toward joy.\n",

This suggests that there is a feeling of recollection or nostalgia, but emotively, it doesn't directly point to any of our predefined emotions without further context. The word inget in isolation typically conveys a sense of remembering something, perhaps with fondness or sentimentality. Is there any joy in this remembering? The addition of the smile emoji later in the sentence does suggest a positive or happy recollection. The context involves recalling an advertisement, which might have humorous or fond implications if it was a funny or memorable ad. However, the word on its own doesn't allow us to conclude anything definitive without considering the smile emoji and the overall tone. In association with the smile emoji, we can reasonably see this as contributing to a sense of joy, reflecting a pleasant or amusing memory. So, tying it together with the context and other keywords, the joy from the smile emoji seems to carry through here.\n",

Like \"inget,\" it's a neutral word until it's paired with contextual emotions or expressions. Does the context around it suggest it’s a positive or negative memory? The context involves remembering a Gojek ad triggered by a previous statement. The presence of the smile emoji following this recollection gives an overall cheerful tone. There is nothing indicating sadness or nostalgia here, only a light and perhaps spontaneous remembrance, leaning more towards joy. Since the smile emoji in guidelines directs us to joy, this memory, not negatively associated, contributes to an emotional atmosphere of amusement or happiness. Therefore, though \"kainget\" itself doesn't scream joy, in conjunction with the smile, it aligns with a joyful emotion.\n",

When people mention that something is \"enakeun,\" they typically refer to a positive experience, suggesting feelings of contentment or happiness. Given its use here, it conveys the idea that the experience of watching or participating is enjoyable. Considering the context of viewing someone who is like a balloon and dances well, it seems playful and light-hearted, adding a positive touch to the interaction.

Dance is a form of expression that can evoke and convey joy, excitement, or even surprise, depending on the context and style.

According to our guidelines, emojis like the thumbs-up are indicative of positive emotions, often associated with joy. The use of multiple thumbs-up reinforces this positivity, suggesting a strong feeling of approval or satisfaction.

      "- Analysis: The text ends with the emoticon \":(\". This is typically used to signify a sad or disappointed face. Emoticons like these often represent negative feelings or emotions. When thinking about why someone would use \":(\", it's usually because they are unhappy or feeling down about a situation. In this context, the text mentions \"Kur aya jang ongkos ngan eweuh jang dahar,\" which suggests a situation where someone has money for transportation (\"ongkos\") but not for food (\"dahar\"). This scenario can be disappointing or distressing, as having only enough money for one necessity and lacking for another can cause feelings of sadness or frustration. It's as if the person is lamenting the fact that they have to choose between two essential needs. The lack of resources is typically associated with sadness because it highlights an unfulfilled need. Based on these observations and the context in which \":(\" is used, it directly correlates with feelings of `sadness`, as the emoticon is a clear expression of that emotion. Thus, this text conveys a sense of sadness and disappointment about the current situation.\n",

This suggests that the speaker finds the comment not only good but also amusing or delightful. According to the guidelines, laughter-like expressions such as \"haha\" typically indicate `joy`. Therefore, it seems clear that the person is expressing pleasure or amusement regarding the comment. This connects to what I noticed earlier about the positive tone of the phrase.

Here, \"kang\" is an informal way of addressing someone, similar to \"bro\" or \"dude.\" The phrase might convey familiarity and a casual tone, suggesting a simple inquiry or engagement in conversation. However, it doesn't necessarily express strong emotions like anger, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. It's more of a neutral, inquisitive outreach, possibly implying a light context of social interaction or seeking someone's location or presence. Without specific guidelines linked to this phrase, I will focus on the friendly and informal aspects of \"kang,\" which could suggest a slight background of friendly rapport, potentially indicating a faint trace of `joy`, given the casual engagement with someone familiar.\n",

The speaker is providing their location or origin. This phrase seems informational and straightforward, more about asserting identity or sharing personal information. There's no immediate emotional cue here based on the translation or use. It's a declarative statement about their place of origin. The emotional context purely from this declaration might seem neutral; however, sometimes declaring one's origin can come with pride or simple joy as it relates to one's identity and belonging. In this context, without further emotional indicators from the speaker's tone or intention, it might not stand alone to strongly denote any of the predefined emotions like anger, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. Yet, a faint background of pride or joy could be inferred from sharing one's origin if contextual enthusiasm was present.\n",

According to the guidelines, emojis like 😂 are laughter-related, indicating a sense of humor or something funny. In this context, the use of these emojis suggests that the speaker finds the situation amusing or humorous. The string of emojis typically strengthens the sense of joy and laughter, suggesting hearty laughter. Now, why would the speaker find the situation funny? The phrase describes an act of drinking water from a glass using an unusual method, which might seem childish or playful. This unusual method of drinking could evoke amusement either because it's a playful action or because there’s an unexpected element to how it’s being done. The act of drinking water in such a lighthearted and possibly exaggerated manner might cause laughter, hence the emphasis provided by the emojis. So, based on both the guidelines and the context in which these emojis are used, it is reasonable to conclude that the emotion expressed here is joy.\n",

      "- Analysis: The thumbs-up emoji \"👍\" is a universal sign of approval or endorsement. When someone uses this emoji, they're expressing satisfaction, agreement, or support, usually in a positive context. Three thumbs-up reinforce this approval with added emphasis, signifying strong positive feelings. Associating this expression with the other language in the text, it aligns with sentiments of joy and contentment. Considering emojis typically enhance or underline our verbal expressions, in this context, the emojis act as amplifiers of the positive sentiment already expressed by words like \"enakeun\" (enjoyable).\n",

This expression aligns with feelings of joy as it communicates a high level of satisfaction.\n",

The rolling on the floor laughing emoji suggests that something is extremely funny or entertaining to the person. The context of the sentence involves someone marveling at how much they enjoy a singer's voice—almost humorously suggesting it's magically enhanced. This itself is a light-hearted, amusing sentiment, fitting very well with typical expressions of joy. In cases like this, where humor and amusement are evident, there's a strong connection to joy. It's also supported by the repetitive, emphasized use of the \"🤣\" emoji, highlighting that the speaker finds the situation very funny. So, building on that last point, since the emojis and the content show admiration conveyed humorously, this connects entirely to joy.\n",

      "- Analysis: The word \"Syukuran\" in Sundanese translates to \"thanksgiving\" or \"celebration\" in English. Celebrations are usually associated with positive emotions, such as happiness or joy. When people gather for a thanksgiving, it's generally a time of gratitude, reflection, and sharing good moments with friends and family. This context inherently carries joyful emotions because such events are meant to be festive and warm, bringing people together in a spirit of thankfulness and community. Based on this understanding, the keyword \"Syukuran\" in this context most likely conveys the emotion of joy, as it implies a positive and cheerful gathering. The notion of celebration alone makes me lean towards the feeling of happiness because it suggests positive sentiments are being shared or expressed.\n",

      "- Keyword: mung bisa ngadoa keun\n",
      "- Analysis: The phrase \"mung bisa ngadoa keun\" translates to \"can only pray\" in English. The use of the word \"only\" or \"mung\" suggests a limitation, but when combined with \"ngadoa,\" which means \"to pray,\" it conveys a sense of humility or acceptance. The person expresses that while they might have constraints, they still offer their prayers, which is a positive sentiment. In many cultures, the act of praying for someone is a sign of goodwill, support, and empathy. So, although there's a hint of a limitation expressed by \"only,\" the overall sentiment is still positive and supportive. This isn't associated with negative emotions such as sadness or disappointment but rather a sincere, joyful intention of wishing well through prayer. In this context, although there could be various interpretations, the phrase aligns more closely with a supportive and joyful sentiment rather than any form of negativity. Therefore, the emotion conveyed here is primarily joy, as it aligns with the intention to convey positivity and sincerity.\n",

      "- Analysis: Hmm... let me think about this phrase. The literal translation of \"ngadamel pulau dina bantal\" is \"make an island on a pillow.\" This is clearly forming an image of something that is impossible or fantastical. In many cultures, using expressions that seem impossible or whimsical tends to transmit a sense of humor or playfulness. Now, referring back to the guidelines, well, there's no specific guideline for this phrase. So, I need to explore the context a bit more. It's part of a dialogue between a father and someone referred to as \"Urng,\" presumably their child. The father's question seems genuine, possibly enquiring about interests or activities, and the response is so outlandish that it might be intended to be humorous. Creating an island on a pillow seems to invoke an image of childlike imagination or just saying something funny to lighten the mood. It doesn't come across as angry, fearful, or sad — far from it actually. It is more in line with joy, especially considering the context of an imaginative and light-hearted answer. The fantastical nature of the response implies a tone where humor or joy is present. Let me build on this a bit further: when you think about playful exchanges or imaginative statements in a familial setting, they often aim to cause amusement and engage others in laughter or smiles. Therefore, with all of this in mind, the phrase 'ngadamel pulau dina bantal' likely expresses the emotion of joy due to its whimsical and humorous nature.\n",

Given that it is paired with the laughter emojis 🤣, it's likely intended to convey the idea of laughing so hard that one cries. This pairing suggests that the text is meant to be taken humorously or ironically, rather than literally conveying sadness.

However, considering the presence of laughter emojis, the phrase might be used in a context that is either sarcastic, ironic, or comedic.

The use of \"mreun\" indicates uncertainty or speculation which, given the context and the phrasing \"anakan,\" carries a light-hearted tone.

      "- Analysis: The phrase \"suksess terus\" translates to \"always successful\" in English. This phrase is generally positive and exudes a sense of goodwill and encouragement. It's typically used to wish someone continued success and happiness. Taking this into account, such a sentiment aligns with the emotion of `joy` as it expresses happiness and positive anticipation for someone's future. Additionally, this encouragement holds a certain vibrancy that sparks a sense of optimism, which can also be linked to `joy`. However, although the sentiment is firmly rooted in positivity, there's an absence of tones that could suggest other emotions like `anger`, `fear`, `sadness`, or `surprise`. Thus, the encouragement and positive anticipation in this phrase unmistakably emphasize a joyful emotion throughout its use.\n",

      "- Keyword: 😢\n",
      "- Analysis: The emoji 😢 is typically associated with sadness. It's a visual representation of crying, usually implying feelings of distress, disappointment, or sorrow. In the given text, this emoji appears after a statement about inability to comment, which suggests a feeling of helplessness or frustration. Since the guidelines state that 😭 could indicate joy in humorous contexts, it's relevant to consider whether 😢 might also be used in a context suggesting humor. However, the text does not seem humorous; it conveys a request for guidance or assistance due to an inability to comment. There's a sense of wanting help, which leans more towards sadness or possibly frustration. The context here doesn't suggest laughter or humor, so it's safe to align the emoji's meaning with its typical use. Moreover, this aligns with the standard emotional interpretation of this emoji. Therefore, this would primarily indicate sadness.\n",

      "- Keyword: nyeri pisan\n",
      "- Analysis: The phrase \"nyeri pisan\" translates to \"very painful\" in English. The use of \"nyeri,\" which means \"pain,\" suggests that there is an intense feeling of discomfort or hurt. In emotional terms, \"pain\" can relate to feelings of sadness or even anger, depending on the context. Now, considering this specific context—someone expressing a personal emotion by exclaiming \"nyeri pisan\"—it indicates a deep expression of suffering or distress. The addition of \"pisan,\" meaning \"very,\" intensifies this emotion, pointing to an experience of acute discomfort. In emotional analysis, this depth of agony can often be linked to deep sadness, as it signifies significant emotional hurt. Sometimes it could reflect anger if the pain stems from an injustice or betrayal, but the context provided here does not specify such circumstances. Overall, the phrase \"nyeri pisan\" primarily conveys sadness due to its implication of experiencing profound emotional pain.\n",

      "- Keyword: duh\n",
      "- Analysis: The interjection \"duh\" is often used to express various emotions like surprise, frustration, or concern. It's intriguing because it's not tethered to a singular emotion and can often depend on the contextual setting of its use. In this text, \"duh\" is used alongside \"neng,\" an affectionate term, and \"nyeri pisan,\" which signifies pain. Considering these elements together, \"duh\" likely underlines an element of concern or empathetic surprise in reaction to the mention of pain. This suggests that the speaker might be expressing a worried or troubling surprise at the intensity of the described pain, rather than excitement or shock. Still, the prevailing emotional theme in this phrase ties back to the primary feeling derived from \"nyeri pisan,\" which is sadness, potentially with an added layer of concern because of \"duh.\"\n",
